## NNDL Milestone 2

### Current 

In our Milestone2, we aimed to enhance performance by focusing on two key aspects:

1. **Data Preprocessing (Jinze Wu and Ziyu Liu)**: We experimented with normalization and data augmentation techniques like rotating, flipping, and brightness adjustments. The effectiveness of these methods was evaluated by comparing their results to those from the baseline SimpleCNN model, helping us identify the most impactful preprocessing strategy.
2. **Model Optimization (Junqi Zou and Chu Qin)**: We explored advanced models such as EfficientNet and ResNet, coupled with hyperparameter optimization. Our goal was to understand the factors contributing to performance variations, providing insights into why certain models performed better.

### Next Step

Moving forward, our focus will be on extensively researching and exploring new models. Our aim is to implement these novel models and assess their performance, to further advance our project.
